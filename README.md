# SNS Resolver
SNS Resolver allows you to create short links from your existing SNS or ANS domain name and redirecting it to your personal website, twitter handle or anywhere else you want. 

Browsers do not support ".sol" TLD and users have no option to simply "link" their site from their SNS domain. SNS Resolver solves this.
